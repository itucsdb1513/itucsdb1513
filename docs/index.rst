Project description
-------------------
We have created a webpage with its own database. The webpage is about the chess game.
You can find information for local tournaments, upcoming events, international ranking of players, history of chess, rules of chess and benefits.
There are 14 tables in total. In all the tables user can add,delete, find and update the data.
Membership is not required for our site. It is thought to be a sharing platform for everybody who is interested in chess.
