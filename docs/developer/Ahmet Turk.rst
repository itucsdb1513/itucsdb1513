+------------+---------+----------+-------------+-----------+
| Attribuite | Type    | Not Null | Primary key | Reference |
+============+=========+==========+=============+===========+
| id         | serial  | 1        | Yes         | No        |
+------------+---------+----------+-------------+-----------+
| name       | text    | 1        | No          | No        |
+------------+---------+----------+-------------+-----------+
| surname    | text    | 1        | No          | No        |
+------------+---------+----------+-------------+-----------+
| win        | integer | 0        | No          | No        |
+------------+---------+----------+-------------+-----------+
| lose       | integer | 0        | No          | No        |

| draw       | integer | 0        | No          | No        |
+------------+---------+----------+-------------+-----------+

   - *id* is the primary key
   - *name* the name of the player
   - *surname* the surname of the player
   - *win* how many times the player won
   - *lose* how many times the player lost
   - *draw* how many times the player drawn

**SQL statement for initializing the local players table : **

.. code-block:: python

      query = """CREATE TABLE localplayers (
                         id serial PRIMARY KEY,

Initializing the Table
++++++++++++++++++++++
The local players table can be initialized by pressing the *initialize table* button that is below the page.
When the table is initialized it shows 25 players.

**SQL statement for initializing the local players table : **

.. code-block:: python

   query = """INSERT INTO localplayers (name, surname, win, lose, draw)
                         VALUES
                          ('ISMET', 'SANCAK', 2, 1, 0),('CAN', 'MIHCIYAZGAN', 1, 1, 0),

   cursor.execute(query)
   connection.commit()


Add Player
++++++++++
Every user can add a player into the table. User should give values for at least name and surname attributes since they cannot be empty.
While adding a new player, the user should take in considerance that the new player cannot have the same couple of name and surname with any other
player in the table since the couple of name and surname attribute is unique.

**SQL statement for aadding a player to the table : **

.. code-block:: python

   def add_player(self, name, surname, win, lose, draw):
        with dbapi2.connect(self.dsn) as connection:
            cursor = connection.cursor()

            query = """INSERT INTO localplayers (name, surname, win, lose, draw)
                        VALUES

            cursor.execute(query)

            connection.commit()
        return redirect(url_for('localtour_page'))

Find Player
+++++++++++
For the local players table there are two ways in which user can find a player. First way is to find
it by the id on the table. Second way is to find it by entering name and surname of the player.

SQL statement for finding player by the id on the table :

.. code-block:: python

   def find_player_with_id(self, id):
        with dbapi2.connect(self.dsn) as connection:
            cursor = connection.cursor()

            query = """SELECT * FROM localplayers WHERE id = %s """ % (id)
            cursor.execute(query)
            player = cursor.fetchall()
        return render_template('findlp.html', player = player)

SQL statement for finding player by name and surname :

.. code-block:: python

   def find_player(self, name, surname):
        with dbapi2.connect(self.dsn) as connection:
            cursor = connection.cursor()

            query = """SELECT * FROM localplayers
                        WHERE name LIKE '%s%%'
                          AND surname LIKE '%s%%'
                        ORDER BY id """ % (name, surname)
            cursor.execute(query)
            player = cursor.fetchall()
        return render_template('findlp.html', player = player)

Delete Player
+++++++++++++
The user can choose one of the two ways for deleting a player from the table.
They can delete a player by its id, by name and surname. However user cannot delete a player who belongs to local games table.

SQL statement for deleting a player by the id on the table :

.. code-block:: python

   def delete_player_with_id(self, id):
        with dbapi2.connect(self.dsn) as connection:
            cursor = connection.cursor()

            query = """DELETE FROM localplayers WHERE id = %s """ % (id)
            cursor.execute(query)

            connection.commit()
        return redirect(url_for('localtour_page'))



SQL statement for deleting a player by name and surname :

.. code-block:: python

   def delete_player(self, name, surname):
        with dbapi2.connect(self.dsn) as connection:
            cursor = connection.cursor()

            query = """DELETE FROM localplayers WHERE name = '%s'
                        AND surname = '%s' """ % (name, surname)
            cursor.execute(query)

            connection.commit()
        return redirect(url_for('localtour_page'))

Update Player
+++++++++++++
A player can be updated by pressing the name of the player that the user wants to update.

SQL statement for opening the  update player page :

.. code-block:: python

   def open_updatelp(self, id):
        with dbapi2.connect(self.dsn) as connection:
            cursor = connection.cursor()
            query = "SELECT * FROM localplayers WHERE id  = %s" % (id)
            cursor.execute(query)
            player = cursor.fetchone()
        return render_template('updatelp.html', player = player)


SQL statement for updating a player :

.. code-block:: python

   def update_player(self, id, name, surname, win, lose, draw):
        with dbapi2.connect(self.dsn) as connection:
            cursor = connection.cursor()
            query = """UPDATE localplayers
                        SET name = '%s', surname = '%s',
                            win = %s, lose = %s, draw = %s

            cursor.execute(query)
        return redirect(url_for('localtour_page'))


Local Games Table

+-----------+---------+----------+-------------+-----------+
| Attribute | Type    | Not Null | Primary key | Reference |
+===========+=========+==========+=============+===========+
| id        | serial  | 1        | Yes         | No        |

   cursor.execute(query)


Initialize Table
++++++++++++++++
User can initialize the local games table to its initial values by pressing the initialize table button.
When the table is initialized it shows the information for 24 different games.

**SQL statement for initializing the local games table : **

.. code-block:: python

   query = """INSERT INTO localgames (playerone, playertwo, result)
                         VALUES

Find Local Game
