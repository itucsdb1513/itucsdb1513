Movement Table
--------------
* This table shows the pieces of the chess game. On the website this table is under the header *Movement of the Pieces*;
  however, in the database it is named as *pieces*.
* The table has four columns. The primary key of the table is the id of the piece and it is generated serially.
* The piece names are unique in this table as each piece can occur only once in the movement table.

+--------------+--------+----------+-------------+-----------+
| Attribute    | Type   | Not Null | Primary key | Reference |
+==============+========+==========+=============+===========+
| id           | serial | 1        | Yes         | No        |
+--------------+--------+----------+-------------+-----------+
| piece_name   | text   | 1        | No          | No        |
+--------------+--------+----------+-------------+-----------+
| piece_move   | text   | 1        | No          | No        |
+--------------+--------+----------+-------------+-----------+
| special_move | text   | 0        | No          | No        |
+--------------+--------+----------+-------------+-----------+


   - *id* is the primary key
   - *piece_name* is the name of the piece
   - *piece_move* is the rule of movement of the relevant piece
   - *special_move* is the special move of the relevant piece

  **SQL statement for creating the Movement Table : **

.. code-block:: python

   class Rules:

      def init_table(self):
        with dbapi2.connect(self.dsn) as connection:
            cursor = connection.cursor()

             query = """CREATE TABLE pieces (
                        id serial PRIMARY KEY,

                        piece_move text NOT NULL,

            cursor.execute(query)
            connection.commit()

Initializing the Table
++++++++++++++++++++++
* The Movement Table can be initialized by pressing the *Initialize Table* button that is below of the tables.
* When the table is initialized it shows 6 pieces.

         connection.commit()

Adding Piece
++++++++++++
* Pieces can be added to the movement table by filling the fields below the movement table and clicking 'Add Piece'.
* User should give values for Piece Name and Piece Move attributes since these attributes can not be empty.
* While adding a new piece, the user should take in considerance that the new piece can not have the same name with any other
  piece in the table since the name attribute is unique.

  **SQL statement for adding a piece to the table : **

        return redirect(url_for('rules_page'))

Find Piece
++++++++++
* Pieces can be retrieved from the Movement table in two ways. One of them is to find a piece by piece name and piece move
  and the other method is just clicking *Find Piece* button and it lists all pieces in the table.

            connection.commit()
        return redirect(url_for('rules_page'))

Update Piece
++++++++++++
* Each piece's data can be updated thanks to the buttons located on the right-side to each piece in the Movement table. After that new page is opened.
* After *Update* button is pressed new data can be entered into the fields that are desired to be changed
  and *Update* button is pushed which completes this operation.
